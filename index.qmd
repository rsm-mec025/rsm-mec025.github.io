Here is a paragraph about me!

Hi! I'm a Master of Business Analytics student at UCSD Rady School of Management with a strong foundation in marketing and a growing expertise in data Analytics. Before grad school, I worked in brand marketing and franchise management roles, where I developed a passion for combining strategy, creativity, and consumer insight. Now, I’m deepening my technical skills in Python, SQL, and predictive modeling, with a keen interest in how analytics can power smarter marketing decisions. I'm actively involved in Rady’s Consulting and Data Analytics Clubs, and outside of class, I enjoy dancing, traveling, and trying new things that keep life exciting and full of growth.
